Client faced with unusual behaviour on checkout, using PayPal Payflow Pro. CC payment didn't work. 
User provided all card data -> Pressed "Place Order" button. Nothing wasn't happen. No errors.

Patch needs to add additional block, route and template to fix this issue.

After patch possible error ##ERROR 10548 - The merchant's account is not able to process transactions, to fix this need to contact PayPal support to configure corectly from their side.
